# HLA_AGENT

HLA_Agent is a framework and a middleware system that allows the integration, through a [High Level Architecture (HLA)](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1516/3744/) federation ([see also](https://www.sisostandards.org/)), 
of multiple instances of the sequential MAS (Multi-Agent Systems) simulation toolkit [SimAgent](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/packages/simagent.html). 

[SimAgent](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/packages/simagent.html) is a pioneering system which is primarily designed to support the design and implementation of very complex,biologically inspired, cognitively rich agents, following the H-CogAFF cognitive architecture.

 **HLA_Agent**, together with [HLA_RePast](https://hla-repast.github.io/) have been **the very first efforts to distribute MAS simulation executives with the HLA**, thus pioneering this topic.
